## ðŸ’» USAGE

[Visit the webpage here](https://astranag.github.io/)

This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS (provided starter code) powered by JavaScript code that I've written. It has a responsive, clean, polished user interface, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

### ðŸ’¬ User story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

```
GIVEN the Code-Quiz app

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
When I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score

```

### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

- A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
- Questions contain buttons for each answer.
- When an answer is clicked, the next question appears
- If the answer clicked was incorrect then subtract time from the clock
- The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
